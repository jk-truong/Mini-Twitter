Notes about the assignment:
 I was unable to complete the entire assignment and only got as far as creating the composite pattern and some of the observer pattern. My biggest difficulties were with getting the GUI and the program itself to communicate data. The GUI had its jtree working and I had a concurrent composite tree working on code. I couldn't get both of them to work synchronously. Most of my time was spent learning how to get both of them to work.
 That aside, an interesting observation was that the OOP concepts from this class re-appeared in my mobile development class while I was creating apps as part of the assignments.
